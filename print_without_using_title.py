# Prog10. title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case. Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.

# ask user for input
# create an empty list to store the capitalized texts
# split the strings
# convert the first letter to uppercase and the rest to lowercase then store in the list
# join the splitted words back to one
# print output
